🚚 File Distribution Blueprint (Preview)
🔹 Client Delivery Logic
Organize assets by project/client/date

Assign unique access links (download or preview)

Optionally time-limit or password-protect access

Embed branding or watermark before delivery (Tier-based optionality)

🗂️ Folder Structure Ideas
/delivery/
├── client_A/
│   ├── 2024_Q4/
│   │   ├── preview_links.txt
│   │   └── assets/ (JPEGs, MP4s, PDFs)
├── client_B/
│   └── retail_drop_2025/
🔗 Link Generation Options
Local network: share via .html page with clickable previews

Web-hosted: use GitHub Pages, Dropbox, or self-hosted instance

Each asset can get:

Static download link

Preview URL

Tracking code (optional)

✍️ Delivery Notes & Metadata Bundles
Include README.txt per delivery set

Client-specific branding folder

Metadata JSON with file info, checksums, timestamps

When you're back, I’ll help you design the actual system flow:

Choose link strategy (static, auto-generated, hosted, local-only)

Map delivery folder logic

Sketch link templates and optional HTML page layout for clients
